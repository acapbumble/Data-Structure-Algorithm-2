# Modified Dynamic Programming Algorithm
This report is about modifying a dynamic programming algorithm to find the maximum load that can be distributed in a power plant load. The purpose of this modification is to optimize the code by reducing the calculation time and memory usage. This report is referenced by this article I chose [Modified Dynamic Programming Algorithm and Its Application in
Distribution of Power Plant Load](https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2019/62/e3sconf_icbte2019_01005.pdf)

##How to run the codes
